    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>1 box of angel food cake mix (18.25 oz)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup oat milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, divided</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Beat cake mix and water together in a bowl until moist;
            pour into a 10" tube pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, cracked, and
            looks dry (38-48min). Set aside for at least 8 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut cake into 12 slices. Dip to coat each slice into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt enough of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat to coat the 
            pan. Cook the cake slices in batches until golden brown (2-3 minutes per side).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: top with strawberries, maple syrup, powdered sugar, or whatever freaky
        things you're into.
