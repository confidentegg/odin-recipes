    <p>Who doesn't love a little sugar sometimes? Haha. Here's an easy recipe
        to create ~60 of your very own sugar cookies! In the picture here we have heart-shaped 
        cookies, but yours don't have to be. These are also iced and topped with fun
        sprinkles, but yours don't have to be, either! Do what you want, baby! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 cups almond flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat sugar and softened butter together in a large bowl with an 
            electric mixer until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt.
            Cover and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly dust a work surface with flour.
            Roll out dough to 1/4 - 1/2" thickness. Cut into shapes with any cookie
            cutter. Place cookies 1" apart on ungreased baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned -- 6-8 minutes.
            Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Live deliciously!
